# mm_color_detection
This project aims to create an autonomous M&amp;M color detection and sorting machine. Using Python and OpenCV for image processing and an Arduino for control, it detects M&amp;M colors in real-time and sorts them accordingly. The system is designed to separate non-M&amp;M objects as well, demonstrating color-based object detection in robotics.
